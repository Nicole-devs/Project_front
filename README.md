### Frontend Setup

Your backend and your frontend should be in **two different repositories**.

Create a new repository in a **separate folder** with a React app for your
frontend. To do this, `cd` out of the backend project directory, and use
[create-react-app][] to generate the necessary code for your React frontend:

```console
$ npx create-react-app my-app-frontend
```

After creating the project locally, you should also
[create a repository on GitHub][create repo] to host your repo and help
collaborate, if you're working with a partner.

### Fetch Example

Your React app should make fetch requests to your Sinatra backend! Here's an
example:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:9292/test")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```
